Hi, I'm Malik and my thoughts tend to not exactly reside here on Earth. This site will host musings and projects as I feel like sharing them. Nothing on this site is guaranteed to stay so if you like it grab it while it's here.

## Musings
[2038](./tech/2038/2018/07/31/2038.html). A _cyber crisis_ that could rival Y2K.

[Configuring a Private Cloud](./tech/privacy/2017/03/31/configuring-a-private-cloud.html). Or how to feel more safe, placebo or not.

## Projects
[PitHub](https://github.com/roninb/PitHub). Productivity app designed to feed your virtual pit bull with GitHub contributions. Created at KnightHacks 2014.

[NASounds](https://github.com/roninb/NASounds-lit-hits). SPA that randomly maps a NASA soundbyte with a key on your keyboard. Randomly press keys to create your own space-based music. Created at HackFSU 2015.

[Maro's Spoiler Bingo](https://malikin.space/zendikarbingo) Bingo Card that randomizes squares based on Mark Rosewater's teasers before a new MtG set release. This is mainly used in my playgroup as a way to keep up with eternal spoiler season.

[Apocalypse](https://malikin.space/apocalypse/apocalypse.html) A basic side scroller I built to pass the time.

## Tales from the Cryptolocker
[Clean Ya Damn Room!](./tech/crypt/2022/03/16/clean-ya-room.html). A reminder that not all technology problems involve technology and that spring cleaning also prevents bugs!

[Near Field Combobulation](./tech/crypt/2022/03/16/nfc.html). Sometimes drivers work and sometimes they really, really don't.

["No, you can't make changes to the help desk because it might break" They Said Before Asking Me to Make Changes to Fix the Broken Help Desk](./tech/crypt/2022/03/16/i-toad-a-sow.html). A case study in reverse engineering (and a reminder to listen to your specialists).
