# Malik in Space
Hi, I'm Malik and my thoughts tend to not exactly reside here on Earth. This site will host musings and projects as I feel like sharing them. Nothing on this site is guaranteed to stay so if you like it grab it while it's here.

## Musings
[2038](./tech/2038/2018/07/31/2038.html). A _cyber crisis_ that could rival Y2K.
[Configuring a Private Cloud](./tech/privacy/2017/03/31/configuring-a-private-cloud.html). Or how to feel more safe, placebo or not.

## Projects
