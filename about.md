Hi! My name is Malik. I'm originaly from the DC Metro area but have lived (for varying short stints) in NY, Barbados, FL, and CA. I enjoy problem solving, music, hockey, figuring out how you think, and learning new things. 

### About this site
This site is mostly a place to host old projects and share interesting stuff I'm doing. There may be hockey and food and art spattered around, but don't let that distract you from all the gidgets and doodads I write about, too.
